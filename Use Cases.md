### **Use Cases for Small Businesses Using Handwritten Digit Classification (MLP)**  

This exercise on classifying handwritten digits with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) using the MNIST dataset can be adapted for various **automation and AI-driven solutions** in small businesses. Below are practical scenarios:

---

### **1. Automating Data Entry from Handwritten Forms**  
- **Use Case**: Small businesses that use handwritten forms such as **invoices**, **order sheets**, or **surveys** can automate data entry.  
- **Example**:  
  A local retail store processing handwritten receipts can digitize totals, dates, or item counts using a similar MLP model.  
- **Impact**:  
  - Saves time  
  - Reduces human error  
  - Minimizes manual data entry costs  

---

### **2. Processing Checks or Bank Deposit Slips**  
- **Use Case**: Recognizing handwritten account numbers, amounts, and dates on **checks** or **bank deposit slips**.  
- **Example**:  
  Small accounting firms or financial services can automate the extraction of numbers from scanned checks for faster processing.  
- **Impact**:  
  - Enhances accuracy  
  - Speeds up financial record-keeping

### **3. Inventory Management with Manual Logs**  
- **Use Case**: Businesses that track inventory on **handwritten logs** can digitize and process numbers for better management.  
- **Example**:  
  A warehouse or small retail store can recognize product quantities, codes, or lot numbers and integrate them into a digital inventory system.  
- **Impact**:  
  - Improves tracking  
  - Reduces errors  
  - Streamlines inventory control

### **4. Digitizing Customer Feedback and Surveys**  
- **Use Case**: Extracting handwritten numeric ratings (e.g., 1-10 scale) from **customer feedback forms** or **surveys**.  
- **Example**:  
  A local restaurant collecting handwritten customer feedback can digitize responses for easier analysis.  
- **Impact**:  
  - Provides actionable insights  
  - Speeds up data analysis  

---

### **5. Ticketing and Service Requests**  
- **Use Case**: Processing ticket numbers or service IDs from **handwritten service requests** or tickets.  
- **Example**:  
  A repair shop receiving handwritten service orders can digitize ticket numbers for better task organization.  
- **Impact**:  
  - Improves efficiency  
  - Enhances organization and tracking

### **Why This Exercise is Great for Small Businesses**  
1. **Low Barrier to Entry**: The MLP model is simple, cost-effective, and easy to implement without advanced AI expertise.  
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Automating manual processes reduces operational costs and increases productivity.  
3. **Improved Accuracy**: Reduces human error associated with repetitive tasks.  
4. **Scalability**: Once implemented, this solution can scale to handle larger datasets or more complex tasks.
